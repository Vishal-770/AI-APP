# Chatbot using React Context API

## Overview

This is a simple chatbot built using **React** that utilizes the **Context API** for state management. The chatbot makes use of Google's **Gemini Free API Key** to process user queries. The app includes features like:

- **useState** for managing local state
- **useContext** for global state management
- **Conditional Rendering** for displaying responses dynamically
- **React Icons** for enhancing the UI

## State Management

The chatbot maintains various states using React's `useState` hook:

```javascript
const [input, setInput] = useState("");
```

- Stores the user input in the chat box.

```javascript
const [recentPrompt, setRecentPrompt] = useState("");
```

- Stores the most recent user query.

```javascript
const [prevPrompts, setPrevPrompts] = useState([]);
```

- Stores an array of previous prompts to keep track of chat history.

```javascript
const [showResult, setShowResult] = useState(false);
```

- Controls whether the chatbot's response should be displayed or not.

```javascript
const [loading, setLoading] = useState(false);
```

- Manages the loading state while waiting for the API response.

```javascript
const [resultData, setResultData] = useState("");
```

- Stores the chatbot's response from the API.
